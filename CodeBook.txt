The values from Test data set a prefixed by Test whereas the Training Values are prefixed by Train.  The suffix would denote whether the column is contains the average of the mean or standard deviation measurements.  For example Train: tBodyAcc-XYZ-mean() is the average of the mean measurements of the tBodyAcc-XYZ from the training data set.  The UCI data set contains a more detailed description of each of the measurments
